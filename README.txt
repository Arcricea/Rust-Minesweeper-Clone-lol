Using winit/wgpu. 

#Current progress:
- Minesweeper with Chording/Flags
- Camera movement with up/down/left/right, Zoom out with mouse wheel
- "Restart" via Tab to clear the instance buffer and delete the board, and then click Spacebar to make a new board / fill the instance buffer

##Installation
`git clone https://github.com/Arcricea/Rust-Minesweeper-Clone-lol
cd Rust-Minesweeper-Clone-lol
cargo build`

##To do:
// GRAPHICS
- Non-square screen sizes makes it explode :c
- Camera Zoom is on the left, rather than in the middle

// UI
- Add UI / Static Elements
- Restart button
- Change game size while ingame
- Win/Loss screen

// SOUND
- Add Music
- Add SFX (?)

// GAMEPLAY
- You can start with a mine? This is so sad.
